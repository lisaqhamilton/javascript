//JavaScript is a programming language which can provide
//dynamic interaction webpages.

//JavaScript can be used for responding to simple button clicks or 
//more extensively to create games or database apps.

//HTML documents must be linked to a .js file at the bottom of the page right
//above the closing </body> tag. Use a <script> tag when linking the 2 files.
//The <script> tag is placed at the bottom because the browser loads reading from
//top to bottom. If done first it could unintendedly affect the HTML page.


//Comments can be done in Javascript with either // or /* (text) */

// In HTML and id for divs and spans so they id can be called in JavaScript
